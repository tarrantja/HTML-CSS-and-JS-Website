    <div class="purpose">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>CSS is a method for managing a sites overall style through a separate stylesheet. CSS allows styling to be
            separated from content (written in HTML) and applied consistently across the whole website. The term
            cascading comes from the ability to combine multiple CSS files to determine the style for one page. This
            means that styles can inherit and overwrite previously declared styles <cite><a
                    href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/look-back-history-css/">(Hoffman, 2017)</a></cite>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A CSS rule set is descripbed in two parts. First, the selector such as an element (paragraph, headings),
            class or
            id. Second, a series of declarations that assign values to style properties such as text colours, background
            colour, font, margins.</p>
            <br>
        <p>For example, we can change the font of all elements:</p>

        <br>

        <ul id="stylelist">
            <li onclick=changeToStyle1()>Style 1</li>
            <li onclick=changeToStyle2()>Style 2</li>
            <li onclick=noCSS()>No Style</li>
        </ul>

                    useful
                    basis for discussion. CSS was distinguished from other styling alternatives by accounting for the
                    design
                    requirements of both author and user, acknowledging a they would need to be ‘cascaded’ in some way.
