        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>CSS is a method for managing a sites overall style through a separate stylesheet. CSS allows styling to be
            separated from content (written in HTML) and applied consistently across the whole website. The term
            cascading comes from the ability to combine multiple CSS files to determine the style for one page. This
            means that styles can inherit and overwrite previously declared styles <cite><a
                    href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/look-back-history-css/">(Hoffman, 2017)</a></cite>.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A CSS rule set is descripbed in two parts. First, the selector such as an element (paragraph, headings), class or id. Second, a series of declarations that assign values to style properties such as text colours, background colour, font, margins.</p>
        <p>For example, we can change the font of all elements:</p>

        <div class="btn-group btn-group-justified">
            <span class="btn btn-default" onclick=timesNewRoman()>Times New Roman</span>
            <span class="btn btn-default" onclick=arial()>Heading 2</span>
            <span class="btn btn-default" onclick=roboto()>Paragraph</span>
        </div>

                    draft of the Cascading HTML Style Sheets proposal <cite><a

                    useful
                    basis for discussion. CSS was distinguished from other styling alternatives by accounting for the
                    design
                    requirements of both author and user, acknowledging a they would need to be ‘cascaded’ in some way.

        <p>This page should discuss the purpose and motivation of CSS, highlighting the benefits of separating content
            from style in web-applications (about 500 words). Again, it should refer to its own styling for motivating
            examples, including using selectors and pseudo-classes.</p>
